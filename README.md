# Ritual Undeadfense
An evil necromancer has been scaring the humans for years. But one day, the humans finally decide to attack the necromancer with the help of magic creatures. You will play as a necromancer in a Tower Defense game, trying to defend your base from the silly, weak "Do-Gooders" by summoning your minion towers using the invocation ritual.
